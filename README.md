# ðŸš€ Project 1 - Vertical Shooter

## ðŸŽ® Overview

This is a classic-style vertical shooter game developed as part of the coursework.  
The game is inspired by retro shooters like *Life Force / Salamander* and is built upon the in-class `space-invaders` codebase.

The objective is to survive through multiple vertically-scrolling stages, defeat waves of enemies, collect power-ups, and defeat the final boss.
